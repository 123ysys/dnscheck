Release Notes for DNSCheck Lib v1.2.3
=====================================
Notable changes:

* Fix for issue #52 in Github, introduced in v1.2.2

* Fix of the "Check for IPv6 NS addresses only at parent or only at child." 



Release Notes for DNSCheck Lib v1.2.2
=====================================
Notable changes:

* Test for NS records pointing at CNAMEs.

* Test for discrepancy in IPv6 presence at parent and child.

* Multiple changes of default policy levels, mostly to do with the growing importance of DNSSEC.

* General fixes for bugs, stability issues and correctness.


Release Notes for DNSCheck Lib v1.2
===================================
Changes since version 1.2:
--------------------------

* Fix an XSS issue in the web GUI.

* Fix a bug in the delegation-testing code.


New features since version 1.1:
-------------------------------

* The dispatcher can now be started as root, and change to a specified user
  and group after it's done with opening files.
  
* The project has moved to Github. It can now be found at http://github.com/dotse/dnscheck


Bugfixes and changes to tests since version 1.1
-----------------------------------------------

* The NO_TCP and NO_UDP tests have been made more reliable.

* Some tests stop earlier if they can't run, avoiding some reports that don't
  make sense (like nameservers that don't respond at all being stated not to
  be recursive).
  
* The concept of "mandatory algorithms" for DNSSEC has been retired. Instead,
  there will be warnings if DNSKEY or DS records are found to be using
  cryptographic algorithms listed as unallocated, reserved or private by IANA.
  
* The DNSSEC tests now deal correctly with SHA-2 keys.
  
* Undelegated tests should work again.

* There are new and changed messages. If you're using the Web GUI, don't
  forget to reload the message table in the database.


Currently known issues
----------------------

* Several DNSSEC tests need improving and/or re-thinking.

* In some instances, the DNSCheck recursive resolver does not get the same
  result as, for example, BIND, due to ours being less forgiving. If we should
  change the current behavior has not been decided.
  
* Zones with nameservers that do not answer queries for DNSSEC-related records
  when the query packet does not have the DNSSEC flag set will get broken
  results from our DNSSEC tests.
  
* There is an outstanding issue where DNSCheck for at least one domain sends
  some queries to the wrong parent zone's servers.
