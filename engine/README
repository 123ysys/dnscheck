How to install the DNSCheck perl library and associated scripts
===============================================================

1) perl Makefile.PL

2) make

3) make test (optional)

4) make install
   This step may need administrative privileges. If so, do su or
   sudo first.

5) Configuration files are installed in $PREFIX/share/dnscheck. $PREFIX
   is the top of your Perl installation tree. If you're not sure where
   that is, you can run "perl -MConfig -le 'print $Config{prefix}'" to
   find out.
   
6) If you plan to use almost any of the included programs or the web gui,
   you need to set up access information for a MySQL database. Copy the
   appropriate part from config.yaml to site_config.yaml and modify to
   match your database setup. The database you point out should be freshly
   loaded with the contents of db/schema.sql and db/index.sql.
   
   
   
Upgrading from DNSCheck version 0.81 to 0.90
============================================

1) Install the library as per points 1 to 4 above.

2) Run db/upgrade_81_90.sql against your database, if you have one. If you 
   have a lot of data in your 'tests' table, this may take some time, during
   which new tests cannot be started and running ones cannot finish. Consider
   doing this during a service window.

3) Check the newly installed config.yaml for keys that you may want to
   override in your site_config.yaml
   
4) Move database access configuration from dnscheck.conf to site_config.yaml
   
5) Change any startup scripts on your server so they run dnscheck-dispatcher
   instead of dnscheck-qrun (which no longer exists).
