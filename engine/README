How to install the DNSCheck perl library and associated scripts
===============================================================

1) perl Makefile.PL

2) make

3) make test (optional)

4) make install
   This step may need administrative privileges. If so, do su or
   sudo first.

5) Configuration files are installed in $PREFIX/share/dnscheck. $PREFIX
   is the top of your Perl installation tree. If you're not sure where
   that is, you can run "perl -MConfig -le 'print $Config{siteprefix}'" to
   find out.
   
6) If you plan to use almost any of the included programs or the web gui,
   you need to set up access information for a MySQL database. Copy the
   appropriate part from config.yaml to site_config.yaml and modify to
   match your database setup. The database you point out should be freshly
   loaded with the contents of db/schema.sql and db/index.sql.
   
7) Do "perldoc DNSCheck::Overview" to get more information about how things
   fit together and which part does what.
