These are tests for DNSCheck.

The tests use a special module, MockResolver, to fake DNS responses from data 
stored in JSON files. That way we can be sure that the tests get predictable 
data, and we do not rely on an external source.

There is also a helper module, MockBootstrap. It overloads the 
Net::DNS::Resolver send() method and records the queries and responses to a 
JSON file. It helps a lot in building initial data for a test.
