These are tests for DNSCheck.

As of this checkin, there is as special DNS tree available for running tests
against. This will hopefully vastly increase the possible coverage and
stability of these tests. So far, only a very few of them work with the
special DNS tree. Have a look at zone.t and soa.t for examples of how to have
DNSCheck use the special tree, and one way to write some tests.
