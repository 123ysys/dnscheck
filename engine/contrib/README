This directory contains various code that was contributed from people outside
the DNSCheck project as such. It's provided with their permission, and unless
otherwise specified in the respective files under the same license terms as
DNSCheck itself.


* dnscheck-demon.pl was contributed by Mark Overmeer. At present it only works
  with the 0.81 version of DNSCheck.
  

* dnscheck-dispatcher.sh is an rc script for the dispatcher daemon for
  FreeBSD. Drop the '.sh' suffix (which is here to avoid having two files in
  the distribution called dnscheck-dispatcher), stick it in
  /usr/local/etc/rc.d and add the enable line in /etc/rc.conf as usual.
